# Joint-Registration-of-Multiple-Point-Clouds-for-Fast-Particle-Fusion-in-Localization-Microscopy
Matlab code for Joint Registration of Multiple Point Clouds for Fast Particle Fusion in Localization Microscopy.
This method is fast, avoids symmetry artifacts, applies to 2D and 3D datasets, and reconstructs poor data with a limited number of particles, a low density of labelling and a large localization uncertainty.

#MATLAB
The code is written in MATLAB, and tested to work in MATLAB R2018-R2020. 
The DIPImage toolbox for MATLAB is required, please see http://www.diplib.org for installation instructions.
Software for Detecting Structural Heterogeneity in Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy Data is required, please see https://github.com/imphys/smlm_classification2d

#Example Usage
Examples of how to use the code on experimental and simulated data is shown in the MATLAB script Example1.m and Example2.m.
